# vWii Theme Injector

A tool that dumps and restores the Wii Menu's asset file.

vWii Theme Injector is a simple tool that works with UWUVCI in order to dump and restore the Wii System Menu file associated with themes. As it stands, this is simply a proof-of-concept and not yet ready for an official release.

## Installation
A Wii U homebrew file will be bundled with each release. It should be placed on your SD card, particularly in `wiiu/apps/`.
* It's important to have the Aroma environment installed for vWii Theme Injector to work. Please visit our [hacking guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/) and the [Aroma webpage](https://aroma.foryour.cafe/) if you would like to softmod your Wii U console.

## Usage
If the program is placed correctly on an SD card, vWii Theme Injector will appear on the Wii U Menu alongside any other homebrew applications. It can then be launched just as anything else.
* If vWii Theme Injector doesn't show up on the Wii U Menu, confirm you placed the WUHB file on your SD card correctly and restart your console.
